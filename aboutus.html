        <p9>Hello, my name is Lev. I am an 8th grader at Emmerson K-12, and my partner Emmett and I are the museum organizers/planners. This means that I work on the layout of exhibits and displays. I make sure everything is in chronological order or organized by theme to create the best possible visitor experience. On museum day, I will be doing a reading of a speech by William Bircher. My project is a 3d render of the battle at Gettysburg.  Outside of school I enjoy programming, videogames, 3D modeling, board games, and sailing. Hope you have a fun time learning about the Civil War!</p9>

        <p9>My name is Emmett W. Christensen, 8th grade. My role in the museum is as one of two Museum Organizers, along with my partner Lev. My live performance is as General William T. Sherman of the Union. I've written a short newspaper that takes place during the week of December 16th - December 22nd, 1860. One new thing I leaned while working on this museum that I had not thought of before, is that when the slaves were freed, sometimes they didn't know what to do. A fun fact about myself is that I am left handed.</p9>

        <p9>Hey! My name is Alana and I'm in 8th grade at EK-12 and loving it! My team role for this museum is Technician/Technology consultant. Along with helping to organize and set up technological exhibits and trying to troubleshoot any technical difficulties that pop up during the museum, I am, along with the other Technician/Technology consultant, Cormac, helping create a live website for our Living Museum through HTML and CSS code! For my live performance, I will be playing the part of our 16th president, Abraham Lincoln! I will be reading the Gettysburg Address, in which Lincoln dedicates a field to the union soldiers who so bravely gave their lives during combat in the Civil war. For my individual exhibit, I am creating an online 3D model of a southern plantation house which will be based of the house that Robert E. Lee lived in, and styled similarly to George Washington's beloved Mount Vernon. In learning about the Civil War, I've loved learning about the different women in the war! Although they may not have been on the battlefield like most of the men, they still played massive roles in the war, and changed history forever with their heroic actions. A fun fact about me is that I am a completive gymnast for Advantage Gymnastics Academy! I recently competed at the State Championships and was thrilled to place 3rd on Uneven bars, 2nd on both Balance beam and Floor Exercise, and 4th All-Around! I hope you enjoy all the exhibits that we have worked so hard on, and I hope the knowledge you gain here will stay with you for a long, long time!

You can find my individual work in the Timeline of Causes exhibit and learn all about the events that led up to the Civil War. Personally, I have had a blast learning about our nation's history, like how the Civil War effected slavery and a colored person's rights. I am driven and passionate about what I believe in. I am a dedicated reader, soccer goalie, and golfer who loves to write fun fictional stories, and enjoys all things art! I hope you have a blast learning all about the Civil War at our Living Museum!</p9>
