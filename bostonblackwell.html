<h1>Boston Blackwell</h1>
<p1>Do you want to hear how I runned away and jined the Yankees? You know Abraham Lincoln ’claired freedom in ’63, first day of January. In October ’63, I runned away and went to Pine Bluff [Arkansas] to get to the Yankees. . . The young boy what cut the whips — he named Jerry — he come along wif me, and we wade the stream for long piece. Then we hide in dark woods. It was cold, frosty weather. Two days and two nights we traveled. That boy, he so cold and hongry he want to fall out by the way, but I drug him on.</p1><br><br>
<p1>When we gets to the Yankee camp all our troubles was over. We gets all the contraband [food taken by Union troops] we could eat. Was they more runaways there? Oh, Lordy, yessum. Hundreds, I reckon. Yes-sum, the Yankees feeds all them refugees on contra-band. They made me a driver of a team in the quarter-master’s department. I was always keerful to do everything they telled me. They telled me I was free when I gets to the Yankee camp, but I couldn’t go outside much. Yessum, iffen you could get to the Yankees’ camp you was free right now.</p1>
